#Udacity build a one page responsive website

Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree project.
I were given a mockup that I had to recreate with my own details and content
The aim of this project was to create a page that is responsive on different kind of devices
I have passed this project with the help of media queries

Enjoy ;)
